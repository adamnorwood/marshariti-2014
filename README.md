MarshaRiti.com WordPress Theme
==============================

Custom theme for children's book illustrator [Marsha Riti](http://marshariti.com/), of Austin Texas.

Sass compilation makes use of Grunt and the Bourbon and Bourbon Neat mixin libraries. Theme also assumes the existence of custom post types for 'Books' and 'Portfolio Pieces', which I've implemented elsewhere as WordPress plugins (those aren't included directly in this theme)
